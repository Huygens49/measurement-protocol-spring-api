# measurement-protocol-spring-api
Reference project for calling Google Analytics Measurement Protocol from a Spring Boot application.

I was having trouble getting requests to the GA Measurement Protocol API working from a Spring app.
This is a quick reference project for if I run into the same problem again in the future.
